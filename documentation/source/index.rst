``ztd.vargs``
=================

The premiere library for handling text in different encoding forms for C software.



Who Is This Library For?
------------------------

Ideally?

Nobody.

This is mostly a proof of concept to make a proposal go through ISO/IEC JTC1 SC22 WG14 - Programming Language, C (AKA, C Standards Committee) easier and faster.

But if you're still curious, well, have a look! It works mostly like ``va_start``, ``va_arg``, and ``va_end``, but so far iterates over all arguments (regardless of whether they were passed statically or not).

.. code-block:: cpp
	:linenos:
	:caption: How snazzy and cool, 3 arguments iterated over and used!
	:name: index-splash_example.cpp

	#include <ztd/vargs.hpp>
	#include <ztd/idk/assert.hpp>

	int imul3(...) {
		ztdc_va_list vl;
		ztdc_va_start(vl);
		int num0 = ztdc_va_arg(vl, int);
		int num1 = ztdc_va_arg(vl, int);
		int num2 = ztdc_va_arg(vl, int);
		ztdc_va_end(vl);
		return num0 * num1 * num2;
	}

	int main() {
		int result0 = imul3(3, 4, 5);
		ZTD_ASSERT(result0 == 60);
		return result0;
	}
