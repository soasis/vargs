API Reference
=============

Each given function aids in iterating over a ``ztdc_va_list``. Currently, the lists are specified to iterate over **all** arguments where possible, unless compiler optimization or similar interferes with the documented ABI and API constraints of a particular compiler / platform combination. This means that for the following:

.. code-block:: cpp
	:linenos:
	:caption: An example piece of code with 2 named arguments that go unused.
	:name: api-named_argument_skip.cpp


	#include <ztd/vargs.hpp>
	#include <ztd/idk/assert.hpp>

	double dmul3([[maybe_unused]] int a,
	             [[maybe_unused]] double b,
	             ...) {
		ztdc_va_list vl;
		ztdc_va_start(vl);
		int num0    = ztdc_va_arg(vl, int);
		double num1 = ztdc_va_arg(vl, double);
		int num2    = ztdc_va_arg(vl, int);
		ztdc_va_end(vl);
		return num0 * num1 * num2;
	}

	int main() {
		double result = dmul3(3, 4.5, 5);
		ZTD_ASSERT(result == 67.5);
		return 0;
	}

Even the named argument ``a`` and ``b`` will be iterated over. (A future revision of this library may correct for this, but it is how it is for now.) This means that you should avoid using this when there are arguments present in the list, and therefore wish to execute ``
